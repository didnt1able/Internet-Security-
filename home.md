Welcome to the Internet Security wiki!

There are many easy ways to keep yourself relatively secure on the internet. I will list a few simple ways below and a small bit of text describing why the practice is useful

Use [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) apps where available. If the service does not support the use of [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm) apps you can your phone number. However having OTP ‘s sent to your phone does come with its own [security risks](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16328172/sms-two-factor-authentication-hack-password-bitcoin), the attack vectors are more obscure and require social engineering or physical access to the phone. Having it is better than not but SMS is inherently insecure. I would personally recommend [Authy](https://authy.com/) as a good TOTP app because it is cross platform and if you keep your devices encrypted and choose strong a strong password it's just as secure and more convenient than other single device options. 

Using a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_password_managers) and generating [random secure passwords](https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator) or [passphrases](https://coinsutra.com/mnemonic-passphrase/) is a habit you should be getting into. Reusing passwords, using insecure passwords is an internet sin that I'm sure most people are very guilty of. That practice is a very bad choice. If one service gets compromised and your password is leaked, can leave your other accounts at risk of being hacked. Make sure you use a secure “[master password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Password)”.  There are many tutorials on choosing passwords that are easy for you to remember and hard for computers to guess. 

Passphrases are a very good option for passwords that you would like to be able to read. I'm sure everyone can agree `“7uUIY67b%^$*ui7^O8h8gyyv%Hijhhl(Y&Y*&”` can be a little hard to type in if you need to sign in on a device that you don't want to install your password manager software on or send through other means. Random passphrases are a string of words from the dictionary so they are easy for you to read and remember following the principles of [mnemonic devices](https://psychcentral.com/lib/memory-and-mnemonic-devices/). `“super-biscuit-fantastic-banana”` is much easier for a human to mentally digest and reproduce in another form. 
    Having these two services are good steps towards securing your online accounts. [This is why you should not use the same password everywhere. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/7qmt4x/howto_acquire_password_dumps_from_the_big_breaches/) Password dumps like this are very easy to get your hands on and if someone gets the one password you use everywhere you are in trouble. There is a service called "[haveibeenpwnd](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)" where you can check if your email has shown up in any of these dumps. ![](https://i.imgur.com/pJ3sXVU.png)  
Here Is a good example of what poor password practices can lead to.
